Data Server</h1>

<div class="body">

<p class="p">With the two flavors of the Distributed Data Server (GPMSERVE and GPM4CIM, also known as RMF XP),
RMF™ offers a solution to monitor the performance of systems in
heterogeneous environments. Application programs that want to retrieve performance data can use the
HTTP API of the Distributed Data Server (DDS). The DDS returns the requested performance data as a
structured XML document. 
</p>
<ul class="ul">
<li class="li">For systems in a z/OS environment, the DDS GPMSERVE component gathers data from the RMF instances running on the sysplex members. An application
program can request selected performance metrics or complete reports from the DDS. Thus, exploiters
of this HTTP API have instant access to a great variety of z/OS performance metrics, including
short-term information as well as long-term historical data.</li>
<li class="li">The HTTP API of the DDS can also
                    serve requests for AIX® and Linux™ performance data, which are directed against
                    an active GPM4CIM instance. RMF XP supports the following operating systems: <ul class="ul" compact>
                         <li class="li">AIX on System p®</li>
                         <li class="li">Linux on System x®</li>
                         <li class="li">Linux on System z®</li>
                         
                    </ul>
                    <p class="p">GPM4CIM is the core component of RMF XP. For detailed information about RMF
                         XP, see z/OS Resource Measurement Facility User's Guide.</p></li>

<p class="p"><a class="xref" href="#ddsapi__erbb7p02">Figure 1</a> illustrates how to use the DDS HTTP API in a z/OS
environment, where requests must be sent to the GPMSERVE component of the DDS. Likewise, in a
heterogeneous AIX/Linux environment, you send your HTTP request to
the corresponding GPM4CIM instance of the DDS. Each instance of GPMSERVE or GPM4CIM uses a unique
port to listen for incoming requests. The returned XML documents have the same syntax for both
Distributed Data Server components.</p>
