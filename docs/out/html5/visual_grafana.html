        create, explore, and share dashboards that are interactive and customizable. The IBM® RMF for z/OS Grafana plugin provides effortless analysis and
        visualization of <span class="ph">Resource Measurement Facility for z/OS</span> (<span class="ph">RMF for z/OS</span>) Monitor III metrics and reports within the

        <div class="p">The <span class="ph">IBM RMF for z/OS Grafana</span> plugin provides the following
                features:<ul class="ul" id="visual_grafana__ul_g42_chq_pyb">
                <li class="li">You can choose various visualization options, such as graphs, charts, panels,
                    and reports, to help you understand your data's trends, patterns, and
                    variances.</li>
                
                <li class="li">You can create dynamic and engaging dashboards by piecing together various
                    panels, each displaying a unique visualization. </li>
                <li class="li">You have the freedom to customize each panel based on your requirements,
                    including its appearance, size, and the data queries it displays.</li>
                <li class="li">Grafana supports integration with numerous data sources, which helps you fetch
                    data from various <span class="ph">Distributed Data Server</span>s (<span class="ph">DDS</span>) and display it in a unified
                    dashboard.</li>
                <li class="li">You can set up alerts based on specific conditions or thresholds in your RMF
                    data. Grafana can trigger notifications via email or other communication
                    channels when these conditions are met.</li>
                <li class="li">You can define a dashboard variable to change the RMF data displayed in your
                    dashboard simply by selecting a value from the drop-down list at the top.</li>
