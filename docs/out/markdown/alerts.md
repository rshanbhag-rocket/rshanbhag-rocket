# Introduction to Alerts {#alerts .concept}

Grafana Alerting feature provides a reliable solution to detect and respond to system issues in real time.

Through Grafana monitoring capabilities, you can keep track of incoming metrics data and configure the alerting system to detect specific events or circumstances. When the system identifies any issues, it automatically sends notifications to ensure that you are up to date. With Grafana Alerting, you can eliminate the need for manual monitoring and control system outages that could lead to significant incidents.

For more information about configuration of alerts and contact points, refer to the [Grafana](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana-cloud/alerting-and-irm/alerting/alerting-rules/create-grafana-managed-rule/) documentation.
